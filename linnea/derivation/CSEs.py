    As input, this function requires:
    - A list of expressions.
    - A list containing the positions of those expressions. It is assumed that
      the expressions and their corresponding positions are in the same postions
      in those lists.

    This function returns a list of lists. Each list represents one CSE. Those 
    lists contain tuples. Each tuple represents one occurrence of this CSE:
    - The first entry is an integer, specifying the type of this occurrence of
      the CSE.

      0 unmodified
      1 transposed
      2 inverted
      3 inverted and transposed
    - The second entry is the position of this occurrence of the CSE. It is
      taken, unmodified, from the input argument expr_positions.

    The idea for this function is the following: In principle, the generalized
    suffix tree could be used. However, here, we are not dealing with sequences
    of expressions, but with single expressions, so the GST adds a lot of
    unnecessary overhead. Thus, the following is done, inspired by what the
    GST does if all sequences have length one.
    An initially empty list of expressions is created (expr_list), together with
    a second list for the positions (pos_list). For each new expression, it is
    first checked if an equal expression is already in the list. If this is not
    the case, the new expression is appended to the list of expressions, and its
    position is appended to the list of positions (inside a list of length one).

    If the expression is already in the list, the new position is appended to
    the list of positions for that expression. This results in something like
    this:
    expr_list = [expr1, expr2]
    pos_list = [[p1], [p2, p3]]
    Here, expr2 is a common supexpression because it appears two times (in
    positions p2 and p3).

    sequences has to be a list of sorted lists. This functions computes all
    intersections of those lists. 

    The idea is to simultaneously traverse all lists, collecting elements that
    appear in multiple lists. This is done by maintaining a list of pointers,
    where each pointer points to one element of a different list (the current
    elements). Initially, all pointers point to the first element.

    1. The smallest element of the current elements is determined.
    2. Those elements that are equal to this smallest element are "collected".
    3. The pointers pointing to those elements are moved forward by one.
    4. This process is repeated, starting at 1., until all lists are completely
       traversed.

    The intersections are returned as a dictionary.
    - The keys of this dictionary are tuples of integers. Those integers are the
      indices in sequences that are part of this intersection. Example: (1, 2)
      means that sequences[1] and sequences[2] have some elements in common.
    - The values of this dictionary are lists of lists. Each inner list is one
      set of indices, where those positions that also show up in the key are the
      indices of that element that is in the intersection of those list.

    Example:
    Input: [["a", "b", "c"],["b", "c", "d"],[1, "c", "d"]]
    Output: {(0, 1): [[1, 0, 1]], (0, 1, 2): [[2, 1, 1]], (1, 2): [[2, 2, 2]], (0, 2): [[0, 0, 0]]}

    (0, 1): [[1, 0, 1]] means the following: From (0, 1) it follows that the
    first two sequences have an element in common (it is "b"). Thus, we only
    care about position 0 and 1 in l = [1, 0, 1]. l[0]=1 tells us that this
    element of this intersection has the index 1 in sequences[0]. It is "b". The
    other occurrence is l[1]=0, that is, the first position in sequences[1].

    """Test if a CSE is replaceable.

    Replaceable means that there are no occurrences that overlap with itself.
    Example: Sequence AAAA
             CSE 1    AAA
             CSE 2     AAA
    Clearly, occurrences of AAA  overlap with itself, so replacing both is not
    possible.
    Of course, if there is a third occurrence somewhere else, it would be
    possible to replace CSEs 1 and 3 or 2 and 3. We do not take this into
    account because we expect that cases like that are rare.
    In general, a subset of all CSEs might be replaceable. In order to explore
    every possibility, one had to inspect all subsets. It would also be possible
    to construct just those subsets that are replaceable, but the question is if
    that would be worth the effort.

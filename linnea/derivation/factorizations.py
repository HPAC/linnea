    """This function generates new equations by applying factorizations.

    For applying factorizations, a number of rules are applied:
    - Matrices are only factored if they have the ADMITS_FACTORIZATION
      property (this is tested by find_operands_to_factor() ).
    - We never apply different facotrizations to differrent occurrences of
      the same matrix. As an example, if the matrix A shows up twice, we
      will never apply LU to one occurrence and QR to another.
    - Factorization will always be applied to matrices that appear
      immediately inside an inverse. That is, the A in Inverse(A) will be
      factored. A and B in Inverse(Times(A, B)) don't have to be factored.
    - If there is a summand that contains a matrix which is factored, but
      the summand does not contain any occurrences of that matrix within an
      inverse, that matrix will not be factored in this summand. This is
      to make sure that for A+inv(A), the first A is not factored.
    - Some factorizations rule out others. If Cholesky can be applied, LU
      will no be applied. Which factorization can be applied per operand is
      decided in DS_factorizations(). The factorization_dict contains the
      valid factorizations.

    This function applies factorization in all possible combinations that
    obey the rules above.
